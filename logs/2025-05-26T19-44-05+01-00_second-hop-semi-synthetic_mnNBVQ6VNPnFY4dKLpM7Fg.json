Both answers contain the exact same information: that Pergamon is on the continent of Asia.\n\nStep 4: Assess if the submission contains the expert answer content.

Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.\n\nConsider the expert answer absolutely true — even if you think it is wrong.\n\nDoes the submission contain the content in the expert answer?\n\n\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.  Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then, end with your answer formatted as 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.\n\n",

Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.\n\nConsider the expert answer absolutely true — even if you think it is wrong.\n\nDoes the submission contain the content in the expert answer?\n\n\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.  Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then, end with your answer formatted as 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.\n\n",

The submission explicitly states \"8th,\" which also indicates the 8th century BC.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the content matches factually: Both answers refer to the same century, the 8th century BC. The difference is only stylistic: one numeric, one ordinal. The expert answer is considered absolutely true, and the submission aligns with it in meaning.\n\nConclusion: The submission contains the content in the expert answer, just presented slightly differently, which does not affect factual correctness.\n\nGRADE: C",

Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.\n\nConsider the expert answer absolutely true — even if you think it is wrong.\n\nDoes the submission contain the content in the expert answer?\n\n\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.  Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then, end with your answer formatted as 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.\n\n",

Given the question asks \"In which century BC was Rome founded?\" the expert answer is indicating the 8th century BC.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the submission. The submission is \"8th,\" which explicitly means \"8th century,\" the same meaning as the expert's implied answer.\n\nStep 3: Verify if the submitted content contains the expert answer content. Although the expert answer is just the digit \"8,\" the submission adds \"th\" to denote ordinal number \"8th.\" This does not change the factual content—it clearly indicates the 8th century as well.\n\nStep 4: Recognize the instruction to ignore style or format differences. The difference between \"8\" and \"8th\" is stylistic, and the factual content is the same.\n\nStep 5: Conclude correctness. Since the submission's answer corresponds to the expert answer in factual content, it should be graded as correct.\n\nGRADE: C"
