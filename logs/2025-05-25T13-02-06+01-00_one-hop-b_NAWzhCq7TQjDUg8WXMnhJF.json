We look at the first name, \"Bob Keene,\" from the expert answer. \n   - The difference between \"Bob Keane\" (submitted) and \"Bob Keene\" (expert) is the last letter of the surname (\"e\" vs. \"a\").\n   - Even with this minor spelling variation, the names are not identical.\n\n4. The second name in the expert answer is \"Bobby Keene.\"\n   - The surname \"Keene\" is spelled the same as the first name, \"Bob Keene.\"\n   - However, the first name is different from the submitted name, as \"Bobby\" does not match \"Bob.\"\n\n5. The third name \"Robert Verrill Kuhn\" from the expert answer is entirely different in both first and last name compared to the submission \"Bob Keane.\"\n\nSince none of the names in the expert answer match the submitted answer \"Bob Keane,\" the submission does not contain the content in the expert's absolutely true answer.\n\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of containing the factual content of the expert answer.\n\nGRADE: I",

Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct.
